🧭 Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

📌 Overview

This project is a Pathfinding Visualizer built using Python (Tkinter & CustomTkinter).
It provides an interactive GUI to create mazes, place start/end points, and visualize popular pathfinding algorithms step-by-step.

🚀 Features

Interactive grid-based maze creation

Random, Circular, and Carved maze generation

Visualization of four algorithms:

BFS (Breadth-First Search)

DFS (Depth-First Search)

Dijkstra’s Algorithm

A (A-Star) Algorithm*

Adjustable speed for visualization
